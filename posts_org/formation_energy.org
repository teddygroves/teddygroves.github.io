#+TITLE: A short story about formation energy

A few months ago I decided to learn more about the formation energy numbers
that appear on the website [[http://equilibrator.weizmann.ac.il/][eQuilibrator]]. I ended up learning a whole lot and
thought I'd write it down here. 

If you're coming to this topic for the first time, you may also want to check
out [[http://equilibrator.weizmann.ac.il/static/classic_rxns/about.html][eQuilibrator's documentation]] or cite:noorConsistentEstimationGibbs2013,
which are both very informative and readable guides to the scientific
background. I've aimed to add some more detail to give an idea of where
eQuilibrator's training data comes from and how it is transformed to take into
account experimental conditions.

* Background

The formation energy of a compound is the amount of energy that is stored or
released by the chemical reaction that creates it out of its constituent
elements. For example, according to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Gibbs_free_energy_of_formation][Wikipedia]], liquid water has a formation
energy of -237.14 kilojoules per mole. This means that creating 1 mole of
liquid water out of gaseous hydrogen and oxygen stores 237.14 kilojoules of
energy from the surrounding environment.

I'm interested in formation energies because I want to model the rates of
metabolic reactions, which depend (among other things) on the thermodynamic
properties of the metabolites that they produce and consume. For example, the
compound ATP has a very low formation energy. Metabolism takes advantage of
this by using ATP to store energy and to drive reactions that would otherwise
be thermodynamically infeasible. Knowing the exact formation energy of a
metabolite can help us to find out if a genetic intervention like knocking out
a reaction or over-expressing an enzyme would help or hinder an organism's
metabolism.

Unfortunately it's not always straightforward to measure a compound's formation
energy. Metabolic networks involve lots of compounds, and not all of them have
been measured accurately. As a result, there is a lot to be gained by taking
advantage of scientific knowledge and statistical machinery, so as to make the
best possible use of the available information. Over the last decade or so, as
metabolic modelling has become more feasible and popular, there has been a
corresponding effort to estimate formation energies more accurately, and to
increase the number of compounds whose formation energy can be estimated.

In this short story I'll try to explain how this kind of modelling works, using
worked examples. I lean heavily on the 'component contribution' method from
cite:noorConsistentEstimationGibbs2013, which underpins the website
[[http://equilibrator.weizmann.ac.il/][equilibrator]] and has a great collection of related [[https://gitlab.com/equilibrator/component-contribution/][python libraries]].

My original code can be found here - to run it yourself you'll need a python 3
environment with the following packages installed:

- equilibrator_cache
- component_contribution
- pandas
- numpy
- scipy

* Data fetching
The maintainers of the equilibrator libraries have very helpfully aggregated
enough machine-readable measurements, auxiliary information and analysis code
for our purposes.

I wrote a short python script to fetch some of this data and store it as csv
files. Here it is:

#+INCLUDE: "src/formation_energy/fetch_data.py" src python

The files ~formation_measurements.csv~, ~redox_measurements.csv~ and
~tecrdb_measurements.csv~ record the results of experiments that can be used to
infer likely values of compounds' formation energies. The other files contain
information about the compounds and their names.

** Exploring the tecrdb measurements

The experiments in ~tecrdb_measurements.csv~ originally come from [[https://randr.nist.gov/enzyme/][this
website]]. The researchers who compiled it scanned lots of papers like this

[[file:../img/citrate_synthase_measurements_paper.png]]

and put them in machine-readable form like this

[[file:../img/citrate_synthase_tecrdb.png]]

It is possible to download the results from [[https://randr.nist.gov/enzyme/][the NIST website]] directly, but I
preferred to use the equilibrator data as this saved some web scraping and also
makes it easier to ensure direct comparability with other peoples' work.

The measurements in the TECRDB record a quantity called $K'$, which is the
ratio, at given experimental conditions, of substrates to products when a
reaction is at thermal equilibrium. This quantity is related to the standard
gibbs free energy of the reaction, which in turn is related to the formation
energies of the compounds involved in the reaction.

Here is a graph showing the distribution of the raw $K'$ measurements for
different reactions, arraged according to each reaction's mean measured
value. Each measurement's colour represents the pH at which it was obtained.

[[file:../img/tecrdb_kprime.png]]

Looking at the colours, it is clear that, for many reactions, the darker, bluer
spots are on the left and the lighter, yellower spots are on the right. For
these reactions, the measured $K'$ values were higher when the experiment was
done at a higher pH. This is what one would expect based on the underlying
science, as many of the measured chemical reactions are sensitive to hydrogen
ions. 

Accounting for the effect of experimental conditions like pH is a key part of
analysing this data.

*** From equilibrium constants to condition-specific standard gibbs free energy changes
In order to connect the reaction-specific $K'$ measurements in the TECRDB with
the compound-specific formation energies that we are interested in, the first
step is to find the gibbs free energy change corresponding to each measurement.

This is straightforward, as the condition-specific gibbs free energy change
$\Delta_r G'^{o}$ at temperature $T$ is related to $K'$ as follows:

$$
\Delta_r G'^{o} = -RT\ln(K')
$$

where $R$ is a physical constant (the universal gas constant).

Applying this transformation produces the following standard gibbs free energy
measurements:

[[file:../img/tecrdb_dgprime.png]]

There is clearly still a systematic dependence on pH for many reactions - I
explore below how the component contribution attempts to take into account pH
and other experimental conditions.

** Formation energy measurements
The next source of relevant data are direct measurements of compound formation
energies, taken from cite:albertyThermodynamicsBiochemicalReactions2003 and
some other sources (see the column 'reference' in ~formation_measurements.csv~
for details). The measurements are of the are all recorded as having been taken
at the same pH and temperature.

Here is a plot of these formation energy measurements:

[[file:../img/formation_dgprime.png]]
 
The range of $\Delta_f G'^o$ values shown here is much greater than that of the
TECRDB $\Delta_r G'^o$ values plotted above. This is because of a technical
limitation that means most biochemical reactions can only be measured when
their $\Delta_r G'^o$ value is close to zero.

** Redox reaction measurements
The table ~redox_measurements.csv~ records changes in reduction potential due
to redox reactions, where a compound gains an electron. For example,
cite:loach2010oxidation records NAD reduction, where the compound NAD(+) turns
into NADH by gaining an electron, as changing the reduction potential by -0.32
Volts per mole.

The reduction potential change $E'$ of a redox reaction is related to its
condition-specific gibbs free energy change $\Delta_r G'^{o}$ by the following
equation:

$$
\Delta_r G'^{o} = -F * E' * \Delta_e
$$

where $F$ is the Faraday constant and $\Delta_e$ is the number of electrons
transferred by the reaction.

Here is a plot of the $\Delta_r G'^{o}$ values of the measured redox reactions.

* How to account for experimental conditions?

This section sets out how the component contribution method preprocesses the
reaction measurements it takes in, so as to take into account the effect of the
experimental conditions under which the measurements were obtained. Most of
what follows comes from cite:albertyThermodynamicsBiochemicalReactions2003,
while the code examples are heavily inspired by the equilibrator packages.

The component contribution method takes experimental conditions into account by
transforming the measured $K'$ values to standard condition gibbs free energies
of reaction, which are then used as inputs to a statistical model. To do this
transformation, component contribution takes advantage of some scientific
knowledge about the effects of temperature, ionic strength and the
concentration of hydrogen and magnesium ions.

** From condition-specific to standard gibbs free energy changes
For each measurement, the component contribution method obtains a
standard-condition gibbs free energy change $\Delta_r G^{o}$ corresponding to
the measured condition-specific value $\Delta_r G^{o}'$ using inverse Legendre
transformations, as described in
cite:albertyThermodynamicsBiochemicalReactions2003. 

The relationship between the two quantities is as follows:

$$
\Delta_r G^{o} = \Delta_r G^{o}' - \frac{ddg}{RT} \cdot RT
$$

The $ddg/RT$ quantity in this equation is obtained by the following procedure:

    1. Find the standard condition $ddg/RT$ value for each microspecies in the
       reaction by inferring it from acid dissociation constants.

    2. Find the condition-specific $ddg/RT$ value for each microspecies in the
       reaction by adding the standard condition value to the legendre
       transform adjustment based on the conditions (pH, pMg, ionic strength
       and temperature) and the microspecies's number of protons, charge and
       number of magnesium atoms.

    3. Find each compound's $ddg/RT$ value by calculating the log-sum-exp of -1
       times the condition-specific $ddg/RT$ of each its component
       microspecies, then multiplying the result by -1.

    4. Find the reaction's $ddg/RT$ value by adding together the product of
       each compound's $ddg/RT$ value and its stoichiometric coeffient.


Here are some python functions I made that implement this procedure with the
help of the package [[https://gitlab.com/equilibrator/equilibrator-cache][equilibrator_cache]], which supplies the standard-condition
$ddg/RT$ for each microspecies and maps microspecies to compounds and compounds
and stoichiometric coefficients to reactions:

#+INCLUDE: "src/formation_energy/legendre.py" src python

Here is the same graph as before, but now with transformed, standard condition
gibbs free energy changes:

[[file:../img/tecrdb_standard_dg.png]]

The colors show the $ddg/RT$ value for each reaction, i.e. essentially the
difference between the untransformed and transformed values. It is clear from
the graph that the adjustments due to Legendre transforms are substantial.

Using inverse Legendre transforms to coerce the measurements to standard
conditions before modelling is better than naively using the $\Delta_r G^{o}'$
values - see the supplementary appendix S1 of
cite:noorConsistentEstimationGibbs2013 for a comparison of these two
alternatives. However, this method introduces several issues. First, any
uncertainty as to the dissociation constants used to infer each microspecies's
standard condition $ddg/RT$ value is ignored. Second, the experimental
conditions - particularly pMg and ionic strength - are not always recorded
accurately and are sometimes missing altogether. In order to maintain
reasonable coverage, the component contribution method imputes default values
where pMg (default value 14) or ionic strength (default value 0.25M) is
missing.

These issues could be addressed by accounting for them when modelling the
transformed data, for example by using a model that can assume different
(hopefully worse) accuracies for measurements where a default ionic strength or
pMg value was assumed. Alternatively, the dependency of measurements on
experimental conditions could be included in a model using forward Legendre
transforms rather than being addressed in pre-processing.
