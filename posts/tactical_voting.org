*tl:dr* If you want to vote tactically, use all available information and don't
forget that other people can also do this.

* What happened?
A company called [[https://www.focaldata.com/][focaldata]] did a MRP analysis of some online surveys that were
completed at some point in September or October and sold it to a group called
[[https://www.bestforbritain.org/][Best for Britain]], who are now using the MRP brand to promote their
[[https://getvoting.org/][tactical voting website]]. Along the way I think some
bad statistics communication happened.

I am interested because I like both multilevel regression models and UK
politics discourse, and also because I have a tangential connection with
focaldata. About a year ago I did a job interview at focaldata and found them
great. They pay people to do best-practice multilevel regressions within a
modern and professional software engineering setup and have a cutting edge
data. I think it seems like a great place to work.

I had some quick chats on Twitter with [[https://twitter.com/dsquareddigest][@dsquareddigest]], [[https://twitter.com/hmclandress][@hmclandress]] and
[[https://twitter.com/JustinIbbett/][@JustinIbbet]] (founder and CEO of focaldata), then wrote up what I thought here.

* What is tactical voting?
Tactical voting is when you vote for something you don't like because you think
this will trick the voting system. In this context it means voting for a
Labour, Liberal Democrat or SNP candidate who you do not support in order to
prevent the Conservative candidate winning in your parliamentary constituency.

* What is a MRP?
Multilevel regression and poststratification means making assumptions about how
different kinds of people vote (specifically a multilevel regression model) and
adjusting these assumptions based on some more assumptions about how many
people of each kind there are (this is called post-stratification).[fn:1]

MRP is nice because, under the right conditions, it can make it possible to
extrapolate from a sample population (e.g. the people who answer a survey) to a
target population (e.g. people who vote on election day) even when the sample
is non-representative. This is a relief because representative samples are
pretty hard to make since people stopped using landlines.

* What is good statistical communication?
I agree with the advice in the last slide of [[https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/event/180918-conference/presentations/18-0_04_Spiegelhalter.pdf][David Spiegelhalter's talk
here]]. In order to demonstrate trustworthiness, statistical analysis should be
**accessible** (ideally it should be possible for someone interested to
reproduce it), **intelligible**, **useable** (i.e. directly the model output
should relate directly to what the communicee cares about) and
**assessable**. Uncertainty should be confidently acknowledged and
represented. Potential misunderstandings should be pre-empted. Careful thought
should go into the the relationship between the communicator and listener.

* What went wrong in this case?
First, MRP is very sensitive to implementation details and there is no way for
anyone to access or assess them. What kind of people were polled? What kind of
effects did the model allow? What assumptions did the model make about what
kind of people live where and who is likely to vote? Noone outside the loop can
answer any of these questions. This is the biggest issue in my opinion - I
can't see any good reason why the analysis couldn't be made fully reproducible.

The second problem is that, even without having any idea what kind of MRP
analysis focaldata did, it was probably not the best possible prediction of the
result on polling day. For one thing, it assumes that nothing will change
between now and then. In the previous election campaign the two big parties
tended to do well at the expense of smaller parties. Noone knows how this
campaign will go, but something will surely change, which means ther is some
uncertainty that the analysis probably isn't taking into account (I say
probably as I can't be /certain/ that they didn't do a [[http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/MRT(1).pdf][dynamic MRP]], but I think
it's highly unlikely).

Another problem is that the analysis likely does not include historical
constituency results, even though these are quite informative as to the future
results. This is the main criticism that have been making on Twitter and I
think it is correct. For example, in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendon_(UK_Parliament_constituency)][Hendon]] the Libdem vote share in the last 3
elections has been between 4% and 12%, but the model [[https://getvoting.org/?postcode=NW4+3BU][apparently]] predicts 27% in
this one. Obviously history is not destiny, but it is surely comparably
relevant to survey data obtained three months before polling day and shouldn't
be ignored completely.

These problems aren't so much with the analysis itself but with its
interpretation as a prediction of the final result. If interpreted as a summary
of the information in the surveys, I think it would probably be fine, though
not so relevant for tactical voting advice. So the problem here is really
useability.

A third thing that went wrong is is that no attempt was made to share any
uncertainty estimates, or indeed much model output beyond these
[[https://getvoting.org/?postcode=NW4+3BU][hard-to-access-or-aggregate screenshots]] of some barcharts presumably
representing point estimates. The advice seems to be very sensitive to small
constituency-level Labour vs Libdem differences, which are probably highly
uncertain in the model, with the uncertainty varying by constituency. There is
no way of telling if the model result is 'the Libdems are definitely ahead of
Labour by 2% here' or 'Labour and the Libdems are about the same, I honestly
can't really tell who is ahead'.

Fourth, the method by which Best for Britain turned the MRP analysis into
tactical voting advice is opaque and probably flawed. I couldn't find any
explanation on the website, so again there is a problem of accessibility and
assessibility. There is another problem though: it's not clear that there is
any principled way of directly turning an MRP analysis into sound tactical
voting advice.

A tactical voting decision doesn't just require require knowing the likely
election result but also knowing how other people are likely to tactically
vote. Even if your best guess is that the Libdem are ahead of Labour in a
constituency, it can be more tactical to vote Labour if you think other people
are more likely to tactical-vote in this direction too. The tactical 'scenario'
on the Best for Britain website seems to just transfer 30% of votes from all
non-first-place Remain parties point estimates to that of the highest one. If
that is really how it works, I don't think it's very realistic.

This is not to say that tactical voters should ignore statistical analysis
(provided it is done properly and communicated well), just that it isn't
enough: you also need some information about the strategic situation.

Fifth, it isn't clear from the website what MRP is, how it can go wrong or what
steps if any have been taken to mitigate against the possible problems. Here
are a few ways in which MRP can go wrong:

- People are more likely to respond to surveys when they think the side they
  support is doing well.
- People who respond to surveys are different from other people, even other
  people with the same demographic characteristics.
- Even with a big sample it's hard to get enough data on all relevant groups to
  make confident judgements.
- Assumptions about what kind of people live where can be wrong.
  
There's no way for users to assess whether any of these pitfalls have been
avoided.

Finally, though this isn't really my area of expertise, there seems to be a bit
of a problem of responsibility. Focaldata know the most about the analysis, but
they don't seem to appear on the website outside a footnote in some
screenshots. Best for Britain seem to have been hoping that people would trust
trust them to find someone good, do independent research into focaldata or
perhaps just be comforted by the magic letters 'MRP'. For their part, focaldata
don't seem to have made proper presentation of their work a condition for
taking part, which seems like a bit of a mistake given that it was always going
to be made public.

* So how should I vote tactically?
First you should use all available information about how people are likely to
vote. This means a) waiting until the last possible moment - for most people
this will be just before election day when YouGov will likely publish a more
up-to-date and reproducible MRP analysis and b) also taking into account
historical results from your constituency.

In addition, you also need to take into account that other people are going to
vote tactically as well, and that most people who do so won't be relying on
Best for Britain's website.
