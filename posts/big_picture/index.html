found
<a href=https://soyouwanttowatchfs.com/post/176876853980/introduction-to-the-isu-judging-system-post-2018>here</a>.</p><p>The gist is that each skater makes two performances: a &ldquo;short programme&rdquo;
lasting a bit under 3 minutes amd a &ldquo;free skate&rdquo; lasting just over 4
minutes. During these programmes the skater attempts a series of &ldquo;technical
elements&rdquo; (i.e. jumps, spins and sequences). A panel of judges numerically
assesses both the individual elements and various aspects of the overall
performance, and these assessments are aggregated into an overall score for the
programme. The skater&rsquo;s final score is the sum of their two programme scores.</p><p>At least to start with, the analysis here is going to focus on one aspect of
the scoring system that these posts are going to focus on are the &ldquo;grade of
execution&rdquo; scores that the judges assign to each element. These are whole
numbers between -5 and 5, representing how well the judge thinks that the
skater pulled off the element. If the skater falls on a jump, the jump&rsquo;s grade
of execution is -5; if they complete the jump but don&rsquo;t land well the grade
might be -1; if they enter smoothly and land perfectly the jump would probably
score 4 or 5.</p><p>The aim will be to make a statistical model that describes and predicts these
numbers. In other words, when a particular skater, say <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuzuru_Hanyu>Yuzuru
Hanyu</a>, attempts a certain jump,
this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=quad+loop">quad loop</a> for example</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AvvcLtKMkOQ?start=54&end=62" style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>we want to know how likely it is that his scorecard will look like
<a href=https://skatingscores.com/2021/natjpn/men/long/jpn_yuzuru_hanyu/element/1>this</a>:</p><figure><img src=/img/quad_loop.png></figure><p>With such a model it might be possible to answer some of these tantalising
questions:</p><ul><li>Could someone game the system by choosing high scoring but easy elements?</li><li>What are the chances that, if two skaters attempt the same programme, the
best skater will get the higher score?</li><li>How good is Yuzuru, really?</li></ul><p>There are lots of ways to narrow this idea down and lots of details to narrow
down. Should we measure all elements or just jumps, or just quad jumps? Should
we include qualitative judgements - for example about whether a jump was over
or under rotated - as well as the quantitative -5 to +5 scores? What
measurement model should we use? Should we allow skaters to change how good
they are over time?</p><p>In my opinion these questions are best left until later. Now it&rsquo;s time to fetch
and format some data, then dive into the tangled cycle of model formulation,
analysis and testing that characterises most projects like this. With luck we
might end up doing something like this:</p><figure><img src=/img/workflow.png alt="Bayesian workflow, as visualised in Gelman, A., Vehtari, A., Simpson, D., Margossian, C.
