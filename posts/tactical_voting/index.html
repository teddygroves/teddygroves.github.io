forget that other people can also do this.</p><div id=outline-container-headline-1 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-1>What happened?</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-1 class=outline-text-2><p>A company called <a href=https://www.focaldata.com/>focaldata</a> did a MRP analysis of some online surveys and sold
it to a group called <a href=https://www.bestforbritain.org/>Best for Britain</a>, who are now using the MRP brand to
promote their <a href=https://getvoting.org/>tactical voting website</a>. Along the way I think some bad
statistics communication happened.</p><p>I had some quick chats about this situation on Twitter with <a href=https://twitter.com/dsquareddigest>dsquareddigest</a>,
<a href=https://twitter.com/hmclandress>hmclandress</a> and <a href=https://twitter.com/JustinIbbett/>JustinIbbet</a> (founder and CEO of focaldata), then wrote up
what I thought here.</p><p>I am interested because I am into multilevel regression and statistical
communication, follow UK politics and also have a tangential connection with
focaldata. About a year ago I did a job interview there and found them
great. They pay people to do best-practice Bayesian statistics within a modern
and professional software engineering setup, have some really cool data and
generally come across very well.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-2 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-2>What is tactical voting?</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-2 class=outline-text-2><p>Tactical voting is when you vote for something you don't like because you think
this will trick the voting system. In this context it means voting for a
non-Brexit candidate who you do not support in order to prevent the
Conservative candidate winning in your parliamentary constituency.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-3 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-3>What is a MRP?</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-3 class=outline-text-2><p>In this context, multilevel regression and post-stratification means making
predictions about how different kinds of people in a sample vote (specifically
using a multilevel regression model) and adjusting these predictions based on
how many people of each kind you think there are in the population at large
(this is called post-stratification).<sup class=footnote-reference><a id=footnote-reference-1 href=#footnote-1>1</a></sup></p><p>MRP is nice because, under the right conditions, it can make it possible to
extrapolate from a sample population (e.g. the people who answer a survey) to a
target population (e.g. people who vote on election day) and vice versa, even
when the sample is non-representative. This is a relief because representative
samples are pretty hard to make since people stopped using landlines.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-4 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-4>What are some criteria for good statistical communication?</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-4 class=outline-text-2><p>I agree with the advice in the last slide of <a href=https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/event/180918-conference/presentations/18-0_04_Spiegelhalter.pdf>David Spiegelhalter's talk
here</a>. In order to demonstrate trustworthiness, statistical analysis should be
<strong><strong>accessible</strong></strong> (ideally it should be possible for someone interested to
reproduce it), <strong><strong>intelligible</strong></strong>, <strong><strong>usable</strong></strong> (i.e. directly the model output
should relate directly to what the communicee cares about) and
<strong><strong>assessable</strong></strong>. Uncertainty should be confidently acknowledged and
represented. Potential misunderstandings should be pre-empted. Careful thought
should go into the relationship between the communicator and listener.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-5 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-5>What went wrong in this case?</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-5 class=outline-text-2><p>First, MRP is very sensitive to implementation details and there is no way for
anyone to access or assess them. What kind of people were polled? What kind of
effects did the model allow? What assumptions did the model make about what
kind of people live where and who is likely to vote? No-one outside the loop can
answer any of these questions. This is the biggest issue in my opinion - I
can't see any good reason why the analysis couldn't be made fully reproducible.</p><p>The second problem is that, even without having any idea what kind of MRP
analysis focaldata did, it was probably not the best possible prediction of the
result on polling day. For one thing, it assumes that nothing will change
between the survey dates (apparently these were done between September and
October) and the election. In the previous election campaign the two big
parties tended to do well at the expense of smaller parties. No-one knows how
this campaign will go, but something will surely change, which means there is
some uncertainty that the analysis probably isn't taking into account (I say
probably as I can't be <em>certain</em> that they didn't do a <a href=http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/MRT(1).pdf>dynamic MRP</a>, but I think
it's highly unlikely).</p><p>Another reason why focaldata's analysis isn't the best possible election
prediction is that it likely (again there's no way to know for sure) does not
include historical constituency results, even though these are quite
informative as to the future results. This is the main criticism that has been
made on Twitter and I think it is correct. For example, in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendon_(UK_Parliament_constituency)>Hendon</a> the Libdem
vote share in the last 3 elections has been between 4% and 12%, but the model
<a href="https://getvoting.org/?postcode=NW4+3BU">apparently</a> predicts 27% in this one. Obviously history is not destiny, but it
is surely comparably relevant to survey data obtained three months before
polling day and shouldn't be ignored completely.</p><p>These issues about prediciton aren't so much problems with the analysis itself
but with its interpretation and presentation. As a summary of the information
in the surveys I think the analysis would probably be fine, but this is not how
Best for Britain want people to use it. In order to make a tactical voting
decision you need the best possible prediction of the election result, and
that's not what this analysis provides. In David Spiegelhalter's terms I think
this qualifies as a problem of usability.</p><p>A third thing that went wrong is is that no attempt was made to share any
uncertainty estimates, or indeed much model output beyond these
<a href="https://getvoting.org/?postcode=NW4+3BU">hard-to-access-or-aggregate screenshots</a> of some bar charts presumably
representing point estimates. The advice seems to be very sensitive to small
constituency-level Labour vs Libdem differences, which are probably highly
uncertain in the model, with the uncertainty varying by constituency. There is
no way of telling if the model result is 'the Libdems are definitely ahead of
Labour by 2% here' or 'Labour and the Libdems are about the same, I honestly
can't really tell who is ahead'.</p><p>Fourth, the method by which Best for Britain turned the MRP analysis into
tactical voting advice is opaque - I couldn't find any explanation on the
website, so again there is a problem of accessibility and assessibility. There
is another problem though, which dsquareddigest <a href="https://twitter.com/dsquareddigest/status/1189876959217631232?s=20">pointed out on Twitter</a>. On its
own a MRP analysis isn't enough to determine sound tactical voting advice.</p><p>In order to make a good tactical voting decision you need to know how other
people are likely to tactically vote. Even if your best guess is that the
Libdems are ahead of Labour in a constituency, it might be more tactical to
vote Labour if for whatever reason you think other people are more likely to
tactical-vote in this direction too. The 'tactical' scenario on the Best for
Britain website seems to just transfer 30% of votes from all non-first-place
Remain parties point estimates to the first-place one. If that is really how it
works, I don't think it's very realistic.</p><p>This is not to say that tactical voters should ignore statistical analysis
(provided it is done properly and communicated well), just that it isn't
enough: you also need some information about the strategic situation.</p><p>Finally, though this isn't really my area of expertise, there seems to be a bit
of a problem of responsibility. Focaldata know the most about the analysis, but
they don't seem to appear on the website outside a footnote in some
screenshots. Best for Britain seem to have been hoping that people would just
trust that someone good must have been involved, or that focaldata's reputation
would speak for itself, or perhaps that the magic letters 'MRP' would satisfy
everyone. For their part, focaldata don't seem to have made proper presentation
of their work a condition for selling their analysis, which seems like a bit of
a mistake as bad advice is now being given out and their work can't easily be
disaggregated from it.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-6 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-6>So how should I vote tactically?</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-6 class=outline-text-2><p>First you should use all available information about how people are likely to
vote. This means a) waiting until the last possible moment - for most people
this will be just before election day when YouGov will likely publish a more
up-to-date and reproducible MRP analysis and b) also taking into account
historical results from your constituency.</p><p>In addition, you also need to take into account that other people are going to
vote tactically as well, and that they probably won't be relying on Best for
Britain's website.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-7 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-7>Footnotes</h2></div><div class=footnotes><hr class=footnotes-separatator><div class=footnote-definitions><div class=footnote-definition><sup id=footnote-1><a href=#footnote-reference-1>1</a></sup><div class=footnote-body><p>See <a href=http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/mrp_voterfile_20181030.pdf>here</a> and <a href=http://benjaminlauderdale.net/files/papers/mrp-polling-paper.pdf>here</a> for some nice papers about MRP.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class=post-tags></div></div><script type=text/javascript src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"></script></body></html>
