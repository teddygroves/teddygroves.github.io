I work at [DTU's Biosustain research center](https://www.biosustain.dtu.dk/)
making statistical models of chemical reactions that happen inside living
cells.

I love football, politics, philosophy and animals.

I have [GitHub](https://github.com/teddygroves),
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/teddygroves) and
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/teddy-groves-9002b8117/) and you can
email me at `groves DOT teddy AT gmail DOT com`.
