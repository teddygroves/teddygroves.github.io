  abstract = {Standard Gibbs energies of reactions are increasingly being used in metabolic modeling for applying thermodynamic constraints on reaction rates, metabolite concentrations and kinetic parameters. The increasing scope and diversity of metabolic models has led scientists to look for genome-scale solutions that can estimate the standard Gibbs energy of all the reactions in metabolism. Group contribution methods greatly increase coverage, albeit at the price of decreased precision. We present here a way to combine the estimations of group contribution with the more accurate reactant contributions by decomposing each reaction into two parts and applying one of the methods on each of them. This method gives priority to the reactant contributions over group contributions while guaranteeing that all estimations will be consistent, i.e. will not violate the first law of thermodynamics. We show that there is a significant increase in the accuracy of our estimations compared to standard group contribution. Specifically, our cross-validation results show an 80\% reduction in the median absolute residual for reactions that can be derived by reactant contributions only. We provide the full framework and source code for deriving estimates of standard reaction Gibbs energy, as well as confidence intervals, and believe this will facilitate the wide use of thermodynamic data for a better understanding of metabolism.},

  abstract = {Reaction-equilibrium constants determine the metabolite concentrations necessary to drive flux through metabolic pathways. Group-contribution methods offer a way to estimate reaction-equilibrium constants at wide coverage across the metabolic network. Here, we present an updated group-contribution method with 1) additional curated thermodynamic data used in fitting and 2) capabilities to calculate equilibrium constants as a function of temperature. We first collected and curated aqueous thermodynamic data, including reaction-equilibrium constants, enthalpies of reaction, Gibbs free energies of formation, enthalpies of formation, entropy changes of formation of compounds, and proton- and metal-ion-binding constants. Next, we formulated the calculation of equilibrium constants as a function of temperature and calculated the standard entropy change of formation {\dh}DfS+{\TH} using a model based on molecular properties. The median absolute error in estimating DfS+ was 0.013 kJ/K/mol. We also estimated magnesium binding constants for 618 compounds using a linear regression model validated against measured data. We demonstrate the improved performance of the current method (8.17 kJ/mol in median absolute residual) over the current state-of-the-art method (11.47 kJ/mol) in estimating the 185 new reactions added in this work. The efforts here fill in gaps for thermodynamic calculations under various conditions, specifically different temperatures and metal-ion concentrations. These, to our knowledge, new capabilities empower the study of thermodynamic driving forces underlying the metabolic function of organisms living under diverse conditions.},
