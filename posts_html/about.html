<h1 class="title">How I made this website</h1>
</header>
<p>I had a go at making a personal website, mainly to share <a href="drag_race.html">my attempt to predict RuPaul's drag race</a>. It was really fun and not as difficult as I thought it would be. I thought I'd write up the steps I went through in case anyone else is curious.</p>
<p>At first I tried using the emacs package <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Publishing.html">org publish</a> - this makes it possible to write all the content for a website in .org files, then convert them all to html files with a quick command <code>M-x org-publish</code>. If you are already used to emacs and org mode I think this is a bit easier than learning how to use a static site generator. I read a few tutorials and found <a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-publish-html-tutorial.html">this one</a> the most useful.</p>
<p>Recently I thought it might be interesting to try using just <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">make</a> and <a href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a>. I like this method because it is quite universal - you can use pretty much the same approach to write books and papers. I found <a href="https://keleshev.com/my-book-writing-setup/">this blog</a> quite helpful for the basic process and then took some further inspiration from <a href="https://www.johnhawthorn.com/2018/01/this-website-is-a-makefile/">this blog post</a> about using make to generate html.</p>
<p>The overall strategy is pretty simple - you write your blog in org files, then write some pandoc commands to turn these into html files, then put these commands in a makefile along with some information about which files require which other ones to exist. When you have changed something and want to update the blog you run the command <code>make</code>, and this should do the minimum possible work to bring everything up to date.</p>
<p>To style the blog I made a tiny modification to the <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css">tufte-css</a> defaults.</p>
<p>To put the website on the internet I used <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a>, which is completely magical - you just push to the repository and seconds later the page has changed.</p>
<p>You can find all the source code <a href="https://github.com/teddygroves/teddygroves.github.io/">here</a>.</p>
